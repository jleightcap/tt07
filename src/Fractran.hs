-- ROM with program
-- 	- program counter points to current factor degree of fraction
-- 	- 8-bit unsigned, 0b11111111 reseved as sentinel 'STOP' value
-- 	- program counter incremenets with clock, pauses at STOP
-- 	- break from STOP either un-pauses counter, or resets to zero
-- have two banks of writable memory for the accumulator, with flip flop toggle output enable
-- 	- both banks share the same address register and data bus
-- 	- accumulator counter points to
-- two phase:
-- 	- 1) read value from ROM and accumulate RAM bank: add terms
-- 	- 2) writeback value to degree RAM bank
-- add together the unsigned value acc and the signed value frac.
-- 	- if any value is negative, don't toggle the banks
